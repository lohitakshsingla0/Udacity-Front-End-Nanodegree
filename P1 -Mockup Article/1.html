<h2><em>MY FUTURE:</em></h2>

<p>
As demand of web developers in multinational comapanies is increasing day by day,so in future I look myself to be placed as web developer in multinational company.I am having huge interest in web development programs.
As I am goint to work as full time web developer so I have to make my aspects building.
</p>
<p>
Making a interactive webpage or a website is not an easy task.Athough my problems will come across so i will try to be motivated all through my nanodegree and further studies.As no one is perfect in codings but I will be trying my best to make my aspects building.Success is all about developing skills through practice.
</p>
<p>
 As I know through my nanodegree many problems will come across, so I will try to be relax and self motivated by following few things:
 <ul>
 <li>I will take sleep and get fresh and will then try to solve problem with fresh mind.</li>
 <li>i will listen some songs and get fresh.</li>
 <li>I will meet someone who will help me in solvong problems.</li>
 <li>I will listen some motivational videos.</li>
 </ul>
